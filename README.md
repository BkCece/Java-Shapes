# Java-Shapes

## Assignment 3 Part 1: Shapes
### Description
- This assignment is for CMPT 213 at Simon Fraser University, taught by Victor Cheung in Summer 2020
- This half of the assignment utilizes drawing and **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** features in Java
- The focus here is in proper use of an **Inheritance Heirarchy**, **OOP**, Package Structure, and effective object structure overall (built off of a recommended **UML Design**)
  - A very general code structure is given fro this project, so a big part of the learning here is in adapting to a given code format and class structure that is required, and learning how it works so that new features can be cohesively added in

### Concepts and Tools
- Built using **IntelliJ** and Java 14
- Java **Swing**, **JPanel**, and **Graphics2D** to draw shapes
- **Interfaces** and **Abstract Classes** *- new concepts that I learned for this project!*

# Unified Modeling Language Designs
## The Recommended Shape Class Heirarchy

## A Simplified UML Class Diagram - Shapes and Client

## Suggested UML with Class Content
